/*
 * A Cursor is an object which is used to traverse a Database.
 *
 * A Cursor structure is separated into 3 components:
 * 1. The btree cursor
 *      This cursor can traverse btrees. It is described and implemented
 *      in btree_cursor.h.
 * 2. The txn cursor
 *      This cursor can traverse txn-trees. It is described and implemented
 *      in txn_cursor.h.
 * 3. The upper layer
 *      This layer acts as a kind of dispatcher for both cursors. If
 *      Transactions are used, then it also uses a duplicate cache for
 *      consolidating the duplicate keys from both cursors. This layer is
 *      described and implemented in cursor.h (this file).
 *
 * A Cursor can have several states. It can be
 * 1. NIL (not in list) - this is the default state, meaning that the Cursor
 *      does not point to any key. If the Cursor was initialized, then it's
 *      "NIL". If the Cursor was erased (i.e. with ups_cursor_erase) then it's
 *      also "NIL".
 *
 *      relevant functions:
 *          Cursor::is_nil
 *          Cursor::set_to_nil
 *
 * 2. Coupled to the txn-cursor - meaning that the Cursor points to a key
 *      that is modified in a Transaction. Technically, the txn-cursor points
 *      to a TransactionOperation structure.
 *
 *      relevant functions:
 *          Cursor::is_coupled_to_txnop
 *          Cursor::couple_to_txnop
 *
 * 3. Coupled to the btree-cursor - meaning that the Cursor points to a key
 *      that is stored in a Btree. A Btree cursor itself can then be coupled
 *      (it directly points to a page in the cache) or uncoupled, meaning that
 *      the page was purged from the cache and has to be fetched from disk when
 *      the Cursor is used again. This is described in btree_cursor.h.
 *
 *      relevant functions:
 *          Cursor::is_coupled_to_btree
 *          Cursor::couple_to_btree
 *
 * The dupecache is used when information from the btree and the txn-tree
 * is merged. The btree cursor has its private dupecache. The dupecache
 * increases performance (and complexity).
 *
 * The cursor interface is used in db_local.cc. Many of the functions use
 * a high-level cursor interface (i.e. @ref cursor_create, @ref cursor_clone)
 * while some directly use the low-level interfaces of btree_cursor.h and
 * txn_cursor.h. Over time i will clean this up, trying to maintain a clear
 * separation of the 3 layers, and only accessing the top-level layer in
 * cursor.h. This is work in progress.
 *
 * In order to speed up Cursor::move() we keep track of the last compare
 * between the two cursors. i.e. if the btree cursor is currently pointing to
 * a larger key than the txn-cursor, the 'lastcmp' field is <0 etc.
 *
 * @exception_safe: unknown
 * @thread_safe: unknown
