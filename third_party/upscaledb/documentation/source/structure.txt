This document describes the structure of upscaledb's source code.

The sources are strictly separated into layers. The layer is encoded in the
directory name of the source files. The lowest layer (0) is reserved for
root.h, which is the header file that must be included FIRST, before all
others.

        0root/root.h

The next layer includes files which do not have any other dependency besides
the one to root.h, i.e. debugging helpers, memory allocation etc.

        1mem/
        1debug/

etc.

The public APIs (upscaledb.cc, hola.cc, upsserver.cc) therefore are at the
top of the stacked layers, in layer #5:

        5server/
        5upscaledb/

When adding a new file, first think hard about the dependencies that it
requires and on which layer it should be implemented.

The use the file templates (documentation/source/template.*) as a starting
point.

As of today, the separation between the layers is not perfect and there are
still a lot of things to do. This is work in progress.
